## Revision: unchanged hardware measurements

Finding `004a8ff4eb78ced5b06fd880ad9b4914110fb01c98ef5368ad7ec762e39b8df0` is **fixed**. This revision changes signal acceptance/polling, adds focused regressions and refreshes the static export/documentation. The existing layout, artwork, wallet configuration, contract source, dependencies and build configuration are preserved. The sections after this revision record describe the earlier delivery; their separate contract/security, native-wallet and phone-input checks were not all rerun here.

### Reproduction and correction

- **Before:** Served the original `dist/` under `/preview/` in Chromium at 390×844, selected Get demo egg → Incubate and sampled the timer/signal every 250 ms for 40 seconds against the real hardware API. The IDLE feed repeated observation timestamps between updates. Timer: **1:00 → 0:51** in 40.120 seconds; **94 samples** showed the false replay error. A focused unit regression also failed before the fix.
- **Cause/fix:** `src/rules.ts:107` rejected all equal timestamps. It now rejects older timestamps and conflicting equal-time epoch/work/distance/status/effective-RPM values, while returning the original accepted Reading for an identical fresh measurement. Format, provenance, fault and freshness validation still run before this branch. Original observation/receipt timestamps remain unchanged, preventing HTTP polling from extending freshness.
- **Polling:** `src/app.ts:276` only accumulates work, persists a new baseline and resets polling cadence for a genuinely new measurement. Identical polls preserve the current reading, pending work and poll delay without restarting recovery. Genuine failures still clear the active reading, preserve the replay baseline and require the existing three-second recovery.
- **After:** Repeated the same real-time live-feed check on the rebuilt export. Timer: **1:00 → 0:21** in 40.176 seconds; **six unchanged responses**, **zero false replay samples**, zero page errors. The displayed countdown rounds remaining time up; this is consistent with continuous active progress. This bounded observation does not guarantee future API availability or cadence.
- **Required build repair:** The original source also reproduced TypeScript diagnostic TS2367 at `selectNft`'s post-await phase check. `src/app.ts:1213` now calls a small predicate before and after the asynchronous ownership read, preserving the same runtime checks while avoiding incorrect static narrowing. The wallet/NFT browser regressions passed with this change.

### Checks actually rerun

Dependencies matching the unchanged lockfile were reused through an external temporary source/build mirror. No dependency/cache directory was created in the repository. The final source was copied to that mirror, checked and built; the complete fresh export was copied back without old hashed chunks. Commands below abbreviate external paths and identify scratch-only checks explicitly.

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
PLAYWRIGHT=<external-playwright> PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=<external-browsers> node tests/e2e.mjs
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=<external-browsers> node test/scratch/live-signal.mjs before
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=<external-browsers> node test/scratch/live-signal.mjs after
IMD_PLAYWRIGHT=<external-playwright> PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=<external-browsers> \
  node .imd/reads/skills/design-critic/scripts/taste.mjs --out test/scratch/taste
node scripts/check-delivery.mjs <fresh-production-export>
git diff --check
```

| Check | Revision result |
| --- | --- |
| Typecheck and production build | Pass; existing `ox` / `node:worker_threads` externalization warning remains |
| Rules/art/export suite | **14/14 pass**, including unchanged ACTIVE/IDLE, zero extra work, original timestamps, stale limits and conflicting/older observations |
| Production-export Chromium suite | **13/13 pass**, zero page errors or missing local resources |
| New browser regression | 390px ACTIVE and 1440px IDLE; 4-second polls of 10-second measurements stay fresh, preserve cadence, count exact work, lock accessory and hatch the same card exactly once at 60 active seconds |
| Freshness/recovery browser regression | Frozen measurement fresh at 14s, unavailable after 15s, no progress while stale; genuinely new measurement waits 3s to resume |
| Existing browser regressions | Persistence/naming/SVG/JSON parity, interruptions/backwards counters, visibility/reload, concurrent tabs, artwork/keyboard/reflow, history restoration, wallet rejection/wrong chain, local claim/proof/hatch/receipt, account/ownership changes and RPC isolation pass |
| Live API comparison | Original 9s vs corrected approximately 40s active progress in separate 40s observations; false replay samples 94 → 0 |
| Design probe | **15/16 pass**; unchanged Connect-header heuristic warning, retained because it is the required wallet control |
| Export integrity | Fresh build equality, relative assets, metadata/runtime assets, null public contract/proof config, ABI/compiler parity, protected paths and byte budgets pass |

The managed browser connector was attempted and could not launch its Chrome distribution. Rendered checks used external Playwright Chromium. The WebKit launch probe reports its executable is absent; no Safari/WebKit observation is claimed. The source-only contract suite was not recompiled/rerun separately: contracts/ABI/compiler artifacts are unchanged, and the Chromium suite exercised real local-chain claim/hatch/proof/receipt behavior using the delivered mock artifacts. No public deployment occurred.

### Better Interface review of this revision

Read the pinned workflow/core principles for all six domains and reviewed the affected signal states within the established design. Inspected the final 390px and 1440px probe screenshots and the live incubation screenshot; the product and Get demo egg remain on the first 390px screen. `DESIGN.md` retains the implemented tokens/type/components/responsiveness and now documents unchanged-reading feedback.

| Domain | Checked in this revision | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accessibility | Native action controls, existing text status independent of color, keyboard lamp regression, probe target/motion checks | No screen reader, physical device or full accessibility audit |
| Layout | Probe reflow/overlap/clipping checks at 320/390/1440; browser suite also checks 768; mobile/desktop screenshots inspected | No native zoom, RTL or localization stress test |
| Writing | False replay message eliminated for identical fresh data; older/conflicting/stale failures remain explicit; exact requested intro/status retained | English only; no user study |
| Typography | Existing scale/weights/tabular countdown preserved; probe and screenshot wrapping checks pass | Platform font variation; no independent font audit |
| Colors | Existing semantic status tokens retained; probe's resolved-solid-background contrast check passes | Artwork/gradient/alpha contrast not certified |
| UI | Running/Resting remain stable across duplicates; stale pause and three-second recovery tested; pending/receipt/frozen/export regressions pass | No native wallet app, Coinbase passkey or 10%-speed Animations-panel review |

High-impact finding: `src/rules.ts:107` / `src/app.ts:276`, false replay interruptions of the primary task; corrected and rechecked using live feed, pure rules and synthetic production-browser tests. No visual redesign or new unresolved design finding was introduced. Synthetic hardware remains confined to QA contexts; the public export only fetches real data. Scratch logs/screenshots are disposable and not shipped; reusable regressions are in `tests/rules.test.ts` and `tests/e2e.mjs`.

Completion: **Complete for this bounded revision**, with the browser/service limitations above. `.imd-responses.json` contains the finding verdict. The original delivery evidence follows for context and is not a claim that every earlier check was repeated.

---


This is worker-side evidence for the continued Squeek Hatchery assignment, not an independent behavior/security certification. The deliverable is a static local demo, real wallet integration and upgradeable **TEST SOURCE**. Public contract/proof-service configuration remains null. No public deployment, hosting command, source-verification transaction or external message was sent.

## Scope and actual checks

| Area | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Production build | Pass: `npm run build`, TypeScript then Vite 8.3.5, relative assets |
| Typecheck | Pass: `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) |
| Rules/art/export tests | 12/12 pass (`npm test`) |
| Local contract suite | Pass: one integrated scenario with 43 negative checks, proxy initialization/callback rollback, two-step admin transfer and upgrade storage retention |
| Production-export Chromium suite | 11/11 pass, zero page errors or missing local resources |
| Phone wallet sheet and input QA | Pass: four Open in links + Coinbase Smart Wallet, all local marks loaded; touch, mouse drag, keyboard, Escape/focus return; no page errors |
| Design probe | 15/16 pass; retained header Connect control is the only heuristic warning |
| First 390 px screen | Product and Get demo egg visible; no horizontal scroll |
| Share metadata/image | Title, favicon, description, og:title/og:image present; regenerated PNG inspected at 1200×630 |
| Public deployment | Intentionally unperformed; contract/startBlock/proofServiceUrl are null |

Dependencies were installed from the unchanged lockfile in a temporary source mirror. All dependency/cache/browser directories stayed outside the repository. The final source/public files were copied to that mirror, built, and its clean `dist/` copied back. The production export is delivered beside source and the existing lockfile. The build's existing `ox` dependency emits a `node:worker_threads` browser-externalization warning; application page-error/resource checks passed in the tested flows.

Commands actually run (external tool paths abbreviated):

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm test
SOLC_MODULE=<external-solc-0.8.30-module> node scripts/compile-contracts.mjs
node --experimental-strip-types --test --test-force-exit tests/contract.chain.ts
npm run build
PLAYWRIGHT=<external-playwright> PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=<external-browsers> node tests/e2e.mjs
IMD_PLAYWRIGHT=<external-playwright> PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=<external-browsers> \
  node .imd/reads/skills/design-critic/scripts/taste.mjs --out test/scratch/taste
PLAYWRIGHT=<external-playwright> PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=<external-browsers> node scripts/share-card.mjs
node scripts/check-delivery.mjs <fresh-production-export>
git diff --check
```

The phone input/wallet-sheet check ran as a bounded Playwright script in `test/scratch/mobile-wallet.mjs`; results are `test/scratch/mobile-wallet-results.json`. Synthetic data/virtual time exist only in QA browser contexts and the explicitly labeled artwork study. Production has no fake-data fallback, quick-hatch flag or automatic offline timer.

## Contract/security evidence

Compiler: solc **0.8.30+commit.73712a01**, optimizer 200, Prague, viaIR false; locked OpenZeppelin **5.4.0**. Compiler input, ABI/bytecode/storage layouts and generated frontend ABI match the delivered source. Runtime implementation size is **14,550 bytes**, below EIP-170's 24,576 bytes.

On a disposable Anvil chain with chain ID 11155111, tests covered implementation initializer lock; atomic proxy initialization and zero admin/cap rejection; one claim/address; permanent claim state after transfer; recipient's separate claim; owner-only one-time hatch on the same token ID; operator rejection; unset verifier; wrong signer/chain/proxy/token/owner/result hash/expiry; empty signature; nonce replay and atomic rollback on verifier failure; bounded name/SVG/traits/growth/accessory/version inputs; cap exhaustion; nested receiver claim/hatch; rejecting receiver rollback; unauthorized verifier config/upgrades/admin calls; direct implementation upgrade rejection; incompatible implementation rejection; reinitialization; two-step admin acceptance; and actual post-upgrade state retention.

Measured gas on the final local run:

- Claim: **194,344** gas.
- Canonical mixed/special-coat hatch: **10,989,948** gas, **14,472-byte SVG**.
- Maximum accepted 16,000-byte SVG + 1,500-byte attributes payload: **12,656,559** gas, below 16,777,216.
- Unit extreme-art fixtures across all accessories reached **14,425 bytes**; these are sampled bounds, not a proof over every possible floating-point session. Onchain caps remain enforced regardless.

The test upgrade retains owner/pending-admin behavior, cap, verifier, claim flags, owner/enumeration, seeds, hatch flag, consumed nonce and stored companion/metadata. Slot/offset/type/label checks accompany runtime checks. It establishes retention for the supplied function-only test upgrade; arbitrary future upgrades remain an admin trust risk.

TokenURI JSON equals the exported JSON after parsing, and its embedded SVG equals the downloaded canonical SVG exactly. No user/NFT/legacy SVG is inserted as HTML. The live stage is generated from validated numeric session data. Mock verifier/server/signers are test-only, use disposable chain accounts and never enter public config. See `artifacts/PROOF-PROTOCOL.md` for the absent real service and its required independent hardware/session validation.

## Browser scenarios and rendered evidence

The Chromium harness serves the actual export at `/preview/`, exercising relative assets. It intercepts synthetic hardware only inside isolated QA contexts and changes runtime configuration responses without rebuilding the JavaScript. It uses the real local ERC721 proxy/mock verifier and a loopback proof endpoint.

1. First screen/subpath/null contract, real-address display, rejected connect retry, and no signing/transaction on connection.
2. Same local card ID becomes hamster; 30-character name; save/reload; coat-only view; exact SVG/JSON equality; new egg afterward; reflow at 320/390/768/1440.
3. Network/stale/simulated/fault interruptions; repeated backwards-counter replay against retained baseline; recovery delay; synthetic document visibility pause; reload preserves progress without offline growth.
4. Two tabs cannot concurrently incubate or create a duplicate egg.
5. Keyboard lamp and all 21 labeled artwork studies at mobile/desktop widths, including all 12 accessories.
6. Configured-contract holdings and claim; wrong wallet chain/switch; rejection then retry; absent proof service; RPC failure; separate demo collection.
7. NFT incubation/review; bad verifier proof then retry; locked rename/name/mode controls while signing/pending; no pre-receipt success; confirmed frozen name and tokenURI/export parity.
8. Account change pauses/deselects the NFT draft; wallet-connected demo still completes with RPC failure.
9. Transfer of the active egg stops growth, preserves its owner draft, disables further incubation and releases the mode lock.
10. A wrong-chain RPC yields unavailable holdings and disabled actions, then recovers after a valid RPC response.
11. Synthetic pagehide/pageshow restoration preserves progress without automatic growth, then reacquires the lock on Resume; lamp aim chosen before Incubate is retained. Native browser BFCache eligibility was not measured.

A live-export console check observed zero console errors and a valid IDLE hardware signal. It also observed one aborted fetch of the entry URL (`net::ERR_ABORTED`); aborted fetches are excluded from missing-asset checks, and no missing local asset was found.

A separate emulated-phone Chromium session checked the actual mobile connect sheet's four vendor links and Coinbase Smart Wallet label/icons, then touch, mouse and keyboard lamp changes, Escape dismissal, visible focus and no overflow. It did not open native wallet apps or complete a Coinbase passkey flow.

Screenshots inspected: `test/scratch/taste/shots/{390,1440}.png`, the mobile wallet/focused lamp images, `test/scratch/e2e/hamster-result.png`, the synthetic mobile/desktop art studies and the regenerated share image. Scratch evidence is intentionally removed from submission; the reusable harness, worker result record and static art study remain delivered. No physical-device, screen-reader or Safari observation is claimed.

## Better Interface consolidated review

Read/applied the pinned workflow and all six domains. Existing brand/stack were preserved. DESIGN.md records actual final-source tokens, typography, surfaces, components and responsive behavior.

| Domain | Checked coverage and corrections | Unperformed/limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accessibility | Native controls/labels/disabled states; lamp slider keyboard and touch; visible white stage focus; sheet inert background, Tab trap, Escape/focus return; inline name errors and text status independent of color | No screen-reader session, physical-device testing or full accessibility audit |
| Layout | Main action before stage at 390; measured 320/390/768/1440 reflow; complete long names; shrinkable preview/stat grids; bottom sheet; local/NFT mode state boundaries | No browser-native 200% zoom, RTL or localization stress session |
| Writing | Exact requested intro/not-live status; plain Claim/Incubate/Review labels; explicit unavailable holdings and verifier/service reasons; no invented dates/supply or cheat-proof claim | English only; no user study |
| Typography | Six-token source scale, three weights, system stack, wrapping names/addresses/counters, tabular live values, 16 px input | Platform fallback variation; no separate font/zoom audit |
| Colors | Existing semantic palette retained; probe passes measured solid text/background requirements (4.5:1, 3:1 large); exposed/local coat masks reviewed with pearl/rainbow and unlit areas | Not a complete artwork/gradient/alpha contrast certification |
| UI | Loading/empty/error/retry/pending/receipt/frozen states; wallet marks; stationary shell/lamp; saved egg→hamster cards; accessory/coat view and canonical export; reduced motion probe | WebKit runtime unavailable; no native wallet/Coinbase passkey session or Animations-panel 10%-speed review |

Applicable findings fixed in this assignment (source locations refer to the final implementation):

| Finding / impact | Source, observation, correction and recheck |
| --- | --- |
| High: previous mint flow/status conflicted with the new task | `src/app.ts:95`, `src/wallet.ts:65`, runtime config. Exact intro/status, wallet-free egg card, separate My NFTs, null contract/service and explicit disabled reasons replace optional portrait mint. Browser null/configured flows pass. |
| High: progress/collection needed one persistent identity and concurrency control | `src/storage.ts:83`, `src/storage.ts:101`, `src/app.ts:560`. One egg card is updated, active progress is saved, Web Locks serialize tabs; no offline advancement. Save/reload/new egg/two-tab/history-event regressions pass; restored pages pause before reacquiring a lock, and pre-start lamp aim is retained. |
| High: onchain owner/proof/upgrade enforcement absent in previous source | `contracts/SqueekHatchery.sol:53`, `:80`, `:125`. Locked/atomic initialized UUPS source, owner verifier config, bound signed result/nonces, owner-only hatch and two-step admin transfer. Local negative/upgrade/callback tests pass. |
| Medium: anatomy/fur/old patterns did not match the brief | `src/art.ts:71`, `:96`, `src/rules.ts:282`. Union exterior, connected body/head, independent curved regional fur and short attached pom; pattern generation replaced by 12 anatomy-anchored accessories. Labeled study and canonical exports inspected/tested. |
| Medium: SVG filter showed a solid rectangle behind the egg | `src/art.ts:96`, explicit `edgeAlpha` / `edgeColor` / `outline` filter inputs. The reproduced rectangle disappeared in final stage/portrait screenshots. |
| Medium: coat clip reuse dropped local color/shading in an intermediate render | `src/art.ts:96`, concrete silhouette in the clipPath. Restored local color/shading, feathered neighboring exposures; visually checked mixed colors, pearl and seven-color rainbow in the art study. |
| Medium: small pins were unreadable as full-animal miniatures | `src/art.ts:52`, crop-specific accessory viewBoxes. Current/next seed/brooch/clip miniatures now use their shapes' bounds; desktop/mobile study inspected. |
| Medium: hidden pom could protrude outside an opaque shell | `src/app.ts:233`, `eggInterior` stage clip. The animal stays inside the shell before hatch; the same group is unclipped afterward. Hatch regression checks both states; final stage inspected. |
| Medium: ownership loss could leave a paused NFT locking other modes | `src/app.ts:1246`, stop/save/release path on failed ownership refresh. Transfer-during-incubation browser regression checks disabled old egg and return to demo. |
| Medium: asynchronous retry refresh could expose transient controls or leave claim disabled | `src/app.ts:1281`, await eligibility/holdings refresh while locked, then explicitly refresh all controls; freeze confirmed review immediately. Rejection, proof failure/retry and held-signing/receipt regressions rechecked. |
| Medium: discovered wallet metadata/focus needed defensive handling | `src/app.ts:1381`, escaped labels/data-image attributes, local fallback marks, stale-sheet guards and focus return to the current header node. Rejected connect retry plus phone sheet/Escape/icons checks pass. |
| Low: inherited ordinary hue names did not match the swatches | `src/rules.ts:248`, hue-anchor names aligned with their actual HSL colors; added primary-hue and 78-digit work boundary checks to the existing rule suite. |
| Medium: first-screen desktop prose exceeded the probe budget | `src/app.ts:399`, shortened saved/lock notes while preserving required copy. Probe recheck passes copy budget at mobile/desktop. |

Final taste@1: render, layout, targets, contrast, casing, tracking, type sizes/faces, glyphs, slogans, repetition, copy budget, chrome, motion and share pass. The one `eyebrows` warning identifies the required **Connect button in the header** above h1; it is a functioning wallet control, not an introductory kicker. Kept and documented. No unresolved reproduced high-impact design finding remains.

## Limits and submission integrity

- No public NFT contract or real proof service is provided/configured; both are deliberately null for this source-only assignment. A future real verifier/service and explicitly selected admin/cap are necessary before a separately authorized live integration. Signatures cannot prove play; the admin can change all rules by upgrade.
- The supplied managed browser connector failed to launch its required Chrome distribution. Rendered validation used installed Playwright Chromium instead. WebKit was installed/attempted but could not launch due missing system libraries (including GTK/Pango); Safari/WebKit remains unverified.
- Browser storage is local and finite; export a copy. Active progress is saved about once per second, so an abrupt crash can lose the last unsaved second. Web Locks require a current secure-context browser. API/RPC availability and vendor mobile links are external dependencies.
- No screen reader, physical phone/wallet app, Coinbase passkey, native zoom, RTL or arbitrary future upgrade audit was performed. Synthetic QA and local-chain results do not establish production anti-cheat security.
- Protected dependencies/build configuration and `.git/`, `.github/`, `.env` and node_modules paths were not modified. `.gitignore` has only a budgeted allowlist for the required artifacts, documented in `artifacts/PATH-BUDGET.md` (786,432-byte aggregate ceiling).
- The export is a clean copy of the final production build with relative URLs, all runtime assets and null public config. No old hashed chunks, source maps, npm archives, vendored registry, dependency/cache directory or submodule is added.
- Final byte measurements: 1,408,192 bytes across 60 added/modified work files (limit 8,388,608); required artifacts 482,587 bytes (budget 786,432); static export 583,282 bytes across 14 files. `scripts/check-delivery.mjs` checks these ceilings, local asset presence, public/export parity, ABI/compiler-source parity and optional byte-for-byte equality to the fresh production export. The root and artifact validation records are identical.

Completion: Complete for the requested static/demo/local TEST SOURCE scope, with the explicit browser/service limitations above. Nothing was publicly deployed.
